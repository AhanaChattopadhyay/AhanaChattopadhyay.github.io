Bonjour!

I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed and received my certification for Module 1 entitled 'Fundamentals of LLMs' of the Hugging Face's 'The LLM Course'.

This module covered fundamental concepts of the Transformers library, including:
* Understanding the Transformer architecture
* Working with pipelines for various NLP tasks (text classification, tokenization, etc.)
* Inference with LLMs
* Bias and limitations


It was a very insightful experience, and I'm looking forward to applying these skills to future projects.

Here is my certification for Module 1:

I'm eager to continue with the next modules and deepen my understanding of natural language processing with Hugging Face!

Stay tuned for more updates on my learning journey.

Bonne journée,
Ahana
