System: Windows ; IDE: VS Code

Step 1: Create a folder.

Step 2: Launch Command Prompt

Step 3: Navigate to your folder by writing the command: `cd (copy paste the absolute path to the folder)`

Step 4: Check if you're in the folder then write the command: `python -m venv .venv` (This will create the .venv folder inside your project folder.)

Step 5: Then type from Command Prompt: `.venv\Scripts\activate.bat` (This will activate the virtual environment.)

Step 6: In case, you want to work with any .py or .ipynb file, place them inside your project folder. 

Step 7: Now open your project folder from VS code: File > Open Folder > Select your project folder

Step 8: Now click on the file you want to work on by selecting it from the folder. 

Step 9: On the top right corner of the file (on the same line as 'code' 'markdown' 'run all'...) if it appears : '.ven(python version) then it's all good. Otherwise, click on 'select kernel' and choose the python interpreter that looks like '.venv\Scripts\python.exe
'.

Step 10: If kernel doesn't appear then from Command Prompt (with venv activated) try: `pip install ipykernel`

Step 11: To deactivate simply type: `.venv\Scripts\deactivate.bat` (This will deactivate the virtual environment.)
