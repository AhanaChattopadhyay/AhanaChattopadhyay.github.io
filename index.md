> I hold a Master’s degree in Natural Language Processing from Université de Lorraine (IDMC) and will shortly begin a PhD at Orange, focusing on formal semantics approaches to enhance conversational understanding in machines. My research interests lie at the intersection of computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, and language models, with a particular emphasis on meaning representation, formal semantics, and frugal methods in natural language processing.
