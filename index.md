Currently a master's student in NLP (Natural Language Processing) at IDMC, I am interested in several areas of Natural Language Processing, such as formal semantics, knowledge graphs, machine learning, and computational linguistics. I aim to pursue a PhD after my master's in order to deepen my knowledge in these fascinating fields, by participating in innovative projects that contribute to technological advancement.
